# Cypress Component Testing Quickstart App for Vue.

This is a completed version of the app from the
[quickstart](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/component-testing/vue/quickstart)
guide for writing component tests for Cypress with Vue.

To view the working tests, go into the /vue/my-awesome-app folder and run:

```bash
npm install
```

Then launch Cypress component testing:

```bash
npx cypress open --component
```

> The `--component` flag launches Cypress directly into component testing

Visit [docs.cypress.io](https://docs.cypress.io) for more information on
component testing with Cypress.
