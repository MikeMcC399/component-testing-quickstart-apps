# Cypress Component Testing Quickstart App for Angular.

This is a completed version of the app from the
[quickstart](https://docs.cypress.io/guides/component-testing/getting-started)
guide for writing component tests for Cypress with Angular.

To try the app locally, first clone the quickstart repo:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/cypress-io/component-testing-quickstart-apps.git
```

Then go into the **angular/my-awesome-app** directory and run:

```bash
npm install
```

Then launch Cypress component testing:

```bash
npx cypress open --component
```

> The `--component` flag launches Cypress directly into component testing

Visit [docs.cypress.io](https://docs.cypress.io) for more information on
component testing with Cypress.
